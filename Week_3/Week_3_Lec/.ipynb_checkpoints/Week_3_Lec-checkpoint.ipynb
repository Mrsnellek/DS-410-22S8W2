    "In this chapter, we will develop a way to estimate an unknown parameter. \n",

    "A statistic based on a random sample can be a reasonable estimate of an unknown parameter in the population. For example, you might want to use the median annual income of sampled households as an estimate of the median annual income of all households in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the value of any statistic depends on the sample, and the sample is based on random draws. So every time data scientists come up with an estimate based on a random sample, they are faced with a question:\n",

    "**“How different could this estimate have been, if the sample had come out differently?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical data can be ranked.  Sorted in increasing or decreasing order\n",
    "* Precentiles are used to rank how many numbers are above or below a given value\n",
    "* If you score in 95th percentile on a test, you can conclude that 5% of the scores were higher than yours.\n",
    "* What if everyone scored 75% on a test, how would you rank the precentiles?  Who scored in the 50% or 95% precentiles?\n",
    "* We need a definition of precentiles that works consistently for all ranks and all lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will define the 80th percentile of a collection of values to be the smallest value in the collection that is at least as large as 80% of all of the values.\n",
